# MoonDime - Proof of Concept

While systematic investment plans allow for a user to set small recurring purchases, MoonDime as an app gamifies this with real time triggers towards small investments into chosen cryptocurrencies.
On top of the users initial investments the user is incentivized to use the application via a native ethereum token "MoonDime (MDT)" currently on the Goerli Ethereum Testnet awarded on eachround of investment.
This application is a take on the concept of investing spare change or tiny amounts through the day, only to withdraw if there is a large spike in certain cryptocurrencies. The upsides could be large and the downside would be one incurring losses in the form of change through time.

 A clear example of how the app would work may be, a user choosing location as a trigger, this could be the user's office - upon reaching his/her office on a daily basis, a tiny user set amount like 4HKD could be invested towards an equivalent coin such as ethereum along with 1 MDT received in the users' web3 wallet. At any point in time, the user could withdraw the fiat balance by converting the portfolio of coins and MDT with a minor trading fee.

Showcase the flow of a user creating a trigger on an iOS 12+ device. The flow goes from adding a label - one could have several triggers so a nickname helps) followed by setting a location and its range followed by finally showcasing the trigger set and enabled.
After creating triggers the user may decide if he wishes to keep these ‚Äúon‚Äù or ‚Äúoff‚Äù.

* If an alarm will ring when the app is closed, a notification will be send indicating that alarm is ringing, and you can stop it from that notification by swiping down and click on "Stop".
* If you dismissed the notification without stoping the alarm, the alarm will continue ringing for 60 seconds, or until you open the app and stop it from there.
